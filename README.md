# Design Patterns

A way for me to learn and understand various Design Patterns defined by the GoF. Code is written in C# and I take no ownership of the original methodologies or strutures being implemented.

## Patterns

**1. Strategy:**

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

### OO Principles:

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
